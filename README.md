##Tic Tac Toe

###Installation

Start by cloning the repository using this command:

~~~python
git clone https://github.com/2021-DEV2-027/TicTacToe.git
~~~

After this navigate to the folder containing the recently cloned repository.

Open .xcodeproj file using Xcode.

When you run the project you will get a main screen containing 9 buttons that represent the game board.

By clicking on a random button the first player will start the Game.

To avoid that user draw other character than X or O we choose to set button text using an enum that contains Player's symbol (X or O).
